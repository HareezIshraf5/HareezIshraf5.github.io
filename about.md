    Hello everyone, thanks for dropping by my blog! I am currently working at an antivirus company as a malware analyst.
    I am really passionate about malware analysis and reverse engineering and also eager to dive deeper into digital forensics and incident response.

  <p>
    Frankly speaking, I am still green in the cybersecurity industry and learning every day especially when it comes to reverse engineering.
    This blog is my little corner to share findings and experiences for educational purposes.

    Apologies in advance if you spot any mistakes, and feel free to ping me at
